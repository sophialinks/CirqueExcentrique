## 🚀 About Me
My name is Sophia Links. I'm currently in my exam year as a Software 
Developer MBO4. I'm continuing my studies in 2023, in Business IT and 
Management, HBO. I reside in Amsterdam and outside of tech work, I own a
business as a singer and song-writer! I love creative work and to combine 
my talents!

I made this website for Cirque Excentrique during my internship at GewoonJeroen. 
I was able to work at Cirque's most prized party location; Their own home 
in Amsterdam; What Is Happening Here Art Gallery!

I hope you take a look and enjoy my work!
